# P-BMS: Blockchain-Based Blood Matching System

P-BMS is a decentralized smart contract solution for managing blood donations and matching processes on the blockchain. It automates donor registration, secure blood type matching, FIFO-based queue management, intelligent expiration handling, and real-time inventory tracking while ensuring transparency, security, and privacy.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Donor Registration:** Secure, blockchain-logged donor identity with address verification.
* **Unique Blood Bag Tracking:** Hash-based code using timestamp and serial number.
* **FIFO Queue Management:** Matches blood bags based on entry order and compatibility.
* **Expiration Handling:** Automatically removes expired blood units.
* **Tamper-Proof Matching:** Only compatible blood types are matched using smart contract logic.
* **Gas-Optimized Donation Logic:** Donation operations use minimal gas.
* **IPFS Integration (Future Work):** Supports decentralized file storage for large data.
* **Built on PureChain:** Zero gas-fee blockchain optimized for medical IoT.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

From a test simulation of 1500 transactions (1000 donations and 500 matches):

* ✅ **Success Rate:** 100%
* ⚡ **Average Latency:** 1.76 seconds
* 📉 **Latency Jitter:** 0.54 seconds
* ⛽ **Avg. Gas (Donation):** 124,927 units
* 🔥 **Avg. Gas (Match):** 3,000,000 units
* 📈 **Throughput (TPS):** 0.57 transactions/second

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
