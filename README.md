**P-BMS: Blockchain-Based Blood Matching System**

P-BMS is a decentralized smart contract solution for managing blood donations and matching processes on the blockchain. It automates donor registration, secure blood type matching, FIFO-based queue management, intelligent expiration handling, and real-time inventory tracking while ensuring transparency, security, and privacy.

**Features**

Donor Registration: Secure, blockchain-logged donor identity with address verification.

Unique Blood Bag Tracking: Hash-based code using timestamp and serial number.

FIFO Queue Management: Matches blood bags based on entry order and compatibility.

Expiration Handling: Automatically removes expired blood units.

Tamper-Proof Matching: Only compatible blood types are matched using smart contract logic.

Gas-Optimized Donation Logic: Donation operations use minimal gas.

IPFS Integration (Future Work): Supports decentralized file storage for large data.

Built on PureChain: Zero gas-fee blockchain optimized for medical IoT.


**Performance Metrics**

From a test simulation of 1500 transactions (1000 donations and 500 matches):

âœ… Success Rate: 100%

âš¡ Average Latency: 1.76 seconds

ðŸ“‰ Latency Jitter: 0.54 seconds

â›½ Avg. Gas (Donation): 124,927 units

ðŸ”¥ Avg. Gas (Match): 3,000,000 units

ðŸ“ˆ Throughput (TPS): 0.57 transactions/second
